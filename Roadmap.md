# PyVecDB Roadmap

This document outlines the future plans and improvements for the PyVecDB project. The roadmap will evolve as the project grows and new features are added.

## Short-term Goals (3-6 months)

1. **Support for additional vector databases:** Integrate support for additional vector database backends, such as HNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World) and FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search).

2. **Improved performance:** Optimize the PyVecDB library to provide faster search and retrieval times by employing better indexing techniques and caching mechanisms.

3. **Support for bulk operations:** Add support for bulk insertion, deletion, and updating of entries to improve performance when dealing with large datasets.

4. **Asynchronous operations:** Introduce support for asynchronous operations using Python's `asyncio` library to provide non-blocking database operations, which can be useful when working with large datasets or when integrating PyVecDB with other asynchronous systems.

5. **CLI and GUI interfaces:** Create command-line and graphical user interfaces for managing PyVecDB databases, making it easier for users to interact with the library without writing Python code.

## Mid-term Goals (6-12 months)

1. **Distributed search:** Implement support for distributed search across multiple PyVecDB instances, enabling users to scale the system for handling larger datasets and improve search performance.

2. **Online learning and model updating:** Add functionality for online learning and updating of the underlying similarity search models, allowing users to continuously improve search accuracy as new data is added.

3. **Improved documentation and examples:** Enhance the documentation with more comprehensive explanations, detailed examples, and tutorials covering various use cases and advanced topics.

4. **Integration with machine learning frameworks:** Provide seamless integration with popular machine learning frameworks, such as TensorFlow and PyTorch, to simplify the process of generating high-dimensional vectors for various data types.

5. **Support for additional data types:** Extend PyVecDB to handle additional data types, such as audio, video, and 3D models.

## Long-term Goals (12+ months)

1. **Automatic model selection and tuning:** Implement an automatic model selection and tuning mechanism that adapts to the user's dataset and optimizes the search performance for their specific use case.

2. **Dynamic scaling and load balancing:** Enable dynamic scaling and load balancing across multiple instances or clusters, allowing PyVecDB to adapt to changes in load and resource availability.

3. **Advanced analytics and visualization:** Provide advanced analytics and visualization tools for exploring and understanding the high-dimensional vector space and similarity relationships between data objects.

4. **Security and privacy enhancements:** Implement additional security and privacy features, such as encryption, access control, and differential privacy, to ensure the protection of sensitive data.

5. **Community growth and ecosystem development:** Foster an active community around PyVecDB by encouraging contributions, providing support, and building a rich ecosystem of tools, integrations, and resources.
